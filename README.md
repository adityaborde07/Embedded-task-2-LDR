# Embedded Systems Task-2 – LDR Sensor Interfacing

## Objective
To set up an embedded development environment and simulate sensor interfacing using Arduino and LDR without physical hardware, as part of Internship Task-2.

## Tools Used
- Arduino UNO
- Tinkercad Simulator
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- LED
- resistor

## Working Principle
LDR changes its resistance based on ambient light intensity. The Arduino reads the analog value from the LDR sensor and processes it to control an output device.

## Code Functionality
- Reads LDR value from analog pin A0
- If the light intensity falls below a defined threshold, the LED turns ON
- If the light intensity is high, the LED turns OFF

## Output
Automatic LED control based on ambient light conditions (smart lighting concept).

## Internship
This project is submitted as **Task-2** of the internship at **Maincrafts Technology**.
